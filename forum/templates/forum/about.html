        <h1>About DjangoForums</h1>
        <p>DjangoForums was a project made by Jason Kim as he was learning the ins and out of the Django Framework. For this project he had to implement many different web-functions such as authentication, database management, and user-interfaces. Once the forum is complete, users will be able to create accounts, log in, make posts, and reply to posts.</p>
        <p>While the Django Framework is indeed very powerful, it's not the only component that makes this site look the way it does. Bootstrap 4 was used alongside Django to do a lot of the styling for this page (mainly organization). Jason's own CSS was used at some points when getting to the nitty-gritty.</p>
